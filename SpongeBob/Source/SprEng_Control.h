// Beware! Changing the types of the members in the above structure ( S32 to S16 etc. ) may result in misaligned data which
// could cause access errors. Always pad to 32 bits by making sure that 16 bit data is paired and if your using bytes group
// them in 4s so that any following 32 bit data sits aligned in the structure. Once your sure the compiler does padding auto-
// matically you can ignore this.......

// Enums are a good way of allocating numbers to things with a nice friendly tag.
// So instead of having to remember what number type Reggie is we just use his name and the compiler equates that with
// the number 4! Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
// We could miss the =1 off the first one if we wanted to start at 0 but we don't coz 0 indicates an empty slot.

// #include this file so it knows what it's dealing with.
