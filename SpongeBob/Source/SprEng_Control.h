// Define how many slots we want. Capital letters is standard for a define like this.

#define	NUMOBJECTS 100 // Called sp_numobjs in the original.

// We don't need to convert the variable sp_tabwidth because that was only used for accessing the objects.
// Because we are about to define each object as a structure we can perform access by using just the object number
// because 'C' knows how big an OBJECT is.........

// In order to make it easier to control an object slot attribute set as an entity we define it as a structure type.

// Note there are some changes from the original file. I've indicated these with a * in the end of line comment sometimes
// adding a reason for the mod when it's not obvious.

// Beware! Changing the types of the members in the above structure ( S32 to S16 etc. ) may result in misaligned data which
// could cause access errors. Always pad to 32 bits by making sure that 16 bit data is paired and if your using bytes group
// them in 4s so that any following 32 bit data sits aligned in the structure. Once your sure the compiler does padding auto-
// matically you can ignore this.......

// Enums are a good way of allocating numbers to things with a nice friendly tag.
// So instead of having to remember what number type Reggie is we just use his name and the compiler equates that with
// the number 4! Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.
// We could miss the =1 off the first one if we wanted to start at 0 but we don't coz 0 indicates an empty slot.

// Now we got all our data definitions out of the way we should look at defining our functions so that other files that need
// to call them know what they will expect to be given in terms of parameters etc.
// I suppose I should have mentioned this earlier but any other file which needs to access stuff in the object system should
// #include this file so it knows what it's dealing with.

// I won't decribe what's going on that much here. If you want to see a description of the fucntions look at them in the main
// file "objects.c" where the code really is............

// Some data needs to be accessed globally so we'll let everyone know what the score is with these variables.
