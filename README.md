The incomplete source code repository for the GBA version of SpongeBob SquarePants: SuperSponge, converted from Visual SourceSafe. Spans from the beginning of the game's development to April 2nd, 2001.

Due to the fact that the vast majority of code predates the release of the Game Boy Advance, compiled ROMs may not fully respect the technical specifications of finalized GBA hardware and thus may not run on regular emulators or the real deal. Preliminary GBA development tools may be needed to assist working with the non-finalized specs.

I do not own anything. Will take down if needed.
